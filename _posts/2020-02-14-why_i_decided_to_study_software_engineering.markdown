I think most times, one of the things that burdens the mind is what can you spend the rest of your life doing that brings you some sort of fufillment. As a kid you think becoming an astronaut or some sort of interplanetery knight would be best suited to spend a lifetime doing, but then you realize that space is'nt a freely accessable  thing and that automatically burries the idea of being a space knight. ![](htthttps://wallpaperplay.com/walls/full/a/4/b/57661.jpgp://) Soon though you realize that your wild imagination and love for adveture would actually be quite useful in a career of video game entertainment and since art and creative ideas are off the list wouldnt it be awesome to learn the inner workings of most computer based entertainment? Most experts in a magazine or internet article nearest you via internet would like to think so!

Of course nothing worth having will be easy to obtian, but a dream is worth any struggle to see through to the end no?

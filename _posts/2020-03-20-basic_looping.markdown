Looping is a useful too inside of ruby that allows the user to loop over a collection.
It is extremley helpful in assiting the user in code that often repeats an insane or hefty number of times.
In order to get things done in quicker manner and also make the code we use look a great deal neater it is also a great idea to use loops, but they also come in different styles to help us do a number of different things. For starters the **loop** executes code started after your execution phrases and example of this is.

1. loop do
2. puts "This is my toilet paper, Hands off!!!"
3. end

when shopping in the midst of an outbreak this tool may be handy in warding off aggressive shoppers but can be utilized in many different ways besides warnings or alarms. Note that using loop in this way will repeat a phrase infinitely and can be stopped by typing *control+c* into the terminal, or using the **break** command inside your code.

1. loop do
2. puts "Ill only tell you once."
3. **break**
4. end

This command should do exactly as the code says and say this once.
when using our next command **counter** it essentially works as a counter for the phrase or line of code you wish to repeat only a specific number of times without all the heavy lifting of typing it in one line at a time over and over again.

1. counter = 0
2. loop do
3. counter = counter +1
4.puts "shove #{counter} of people out of the way}
5.  
6. if counter >= 5
7. break
8. end
9. end

this code should have allowed you to push through the crowd and make it safely into the parking lot.

These are some examples of basic ways to use loops.
Be safe and make sure to wash those hands :)
